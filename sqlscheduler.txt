1. Enabled the event_scheduler in the db like this:

 SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
   
 2. create an event, 
CREATE EVENT <name>
    
Called the event to run on a schedule like so: 
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 20 SECOND
    Add the SQL query to the event: DO DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <time_stamp_column> < NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE


CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS `expirer` ON SCHEDULE EVERY 60 SECOND
 DO
 DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `expdate` < NOW();
